1;Configure dotenv.------ dotenv.config()
2:Instance of express-----const app=express()
3:Middleware(anything that comes before Routes /using app.smth())
5.Create Server...app.listen()



ERRORS I HAD WERE SOLVED BY ADDING THE MIDDLEWARES BELOW ALWAYS PASS THEM
// Middleware to parse JSON
app.use(express.json()); // Parses JSON request body
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true })); // Parses URL-encoded data

Add this before defining your routes in server.ts:
Without this middleware, req.body will be undefined, causing the error.
âœ… Solution: Always use app.use(express.json()); at the top of your server file.
